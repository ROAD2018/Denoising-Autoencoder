# Denoising-Autoencoder
Denoising autoencoder with attention to eliminate noise in the soil moisture content recorded at different locations in the United States.
The steps involved in building the model:

- Data analysis and visualisation for feature selection and engineering
- Collectiom of data from different sources and feature selection based on noise and sequence lengths
- Building gru and lstm encoder decoder models to predict the denoised sequence of soil moisture values
- Implementing an ensemble model of gru and lstm to improve the denoising predictions
